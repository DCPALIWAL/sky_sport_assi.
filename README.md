This project dives deep into group stage and overall performance statistics of World Cup teams using structured queries to extract insights like: ✅ Top-performing teams by goals and wins

 ✅ Average possession, passes, and player age by group

 ✅ Advanced stats like expected goals and per90 metrics

 ✅ Insights using aggregation and JOINs for group-level analysis

🛠️ Tools Used:

MySQL

Realistic sports stats data (Group stage + Overall performance)

50+ SQL queries covering filtering, aggregation, subqueries, joins, and more

Through this project, I sharpened my ability to: 📌 Write efficient and insightful SQL queries

 📌 Analyze performance metrics from large datasets

 📌 Transform raw data into actionable insights for sports analysis
